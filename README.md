# Blockchain Implementation

This project implements a simple blockchain using Python. It includes features like:

- Proof of Work (PoW) for mining blocks.
- Block validation to ensure the integrity of the blockchain.
- Adding new blocks and displaying the entire blockchain.

## Features

- **Mining**: Blocks are mined using a proof of work algorithm with difficulty.
- **Blockchain**: The structure to hold blocks with references to previous ones.
- **Genesis Block**: The first block that starts the chain.
- **Block Validation**: Ensures that the blockchain is unbroken and each block links to the previous correctly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries (for simplicity)

## Running the Project

To run the blockchain example, simply execute the Python script:

```bash
python blockchain.py
